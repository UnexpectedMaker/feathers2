# CircuitPython on FeatherS2 Neo
Here you'll find the bleeding edge version of the files I'll eventually ship on all FeatherS2 Neo boards.

## Change list
- 2021-09-18 Initial public release of the MatrixMessage class for displaying messages on the matrix

## Known issues
- Matrix display rotation properties in place, but not implemented yet

## Planned
- Add more glyphs to the default font
- Convert font data to bytes to reduce memory usage (once font is complete)
- Add ability to select a different font (need to document the font format first)
